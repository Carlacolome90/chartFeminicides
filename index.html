<h3> <em>Havana, despite being the capital of the country, is not the province that most worries Cuban activists fighting against femicide.

<p>The number of femicides in all of Cuba reaches 78, according to the <a href="https://alastensas.com/documentos/listado-de-feminicidios-en-cuba-en-el-ano-2023/?fbclid=IwAR3amWzd55dUtdSfs24NIt1SjSbr5TsGb1zxjzxSkl3evJdJc9KVB4nl338" target="_blank">records of the gender observatories.</a>
</p>


<p>Although Havana, the country's capital, is where the highest number of femicides have been reported in 2023, the province where the highest rate of crimes have been committed in relation to its female population is Mayabeque (3.2), followed by Matanzas (2.5).

<p>According to Martha María Ramírez, coordinator of the YoSíTeCreoCuba gender observatory, this could be due to the fact that there are greater complaints from these places.
</p>

<p>“It may be that they are closer to the capital and therefore they have greater access to the Internet and resources to report, something that does not happen in the most impoverished provinces of the country,” says Ramírez.
</p>

<p>She also insisted that state campaigns and organizations that address gender issues are concentrated in Havana, something that does not happen in the rest of the provinces.
